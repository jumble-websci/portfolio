## Log:
I started by taking a look at all my old work from Intro to ITWS to remember how to do any of this. Luckily it came
back pretty fast. I started to make a basic looking resume page, having to look up how to style lists in different ways.
Something that I didn't expect to be hard to do was to get my objective statement to be at the top of the area it could be
so it was right under the contact information instead of having a lot of awkward space between the contact information and 
the statement. It got frustrating enough to take a break. After, I was able to get help from Vishal who had done it the way I wanted.
After that it was mostly just a grind, copying and pasting the same code and rewriting the text. The microformat was 
surprisingly painless, assuming I did it correctly. I also only had very basic errors in my html like forgetting to end a 
symbol with a `;`.  Overall it took a while but I'm happy that there weren't *that* many roadblocks.
